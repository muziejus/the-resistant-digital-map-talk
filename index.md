Note: Thanks all for coming. Thanks Maira for the invitation.

I bring you glad tidings from lands that have welcomed many throughout
history, including the Wappinger and Munsee Lenape peoples.

I don’t have a lot of time tonight, and I want to spend a lot of it hearing
from you and learning more about how you plan on building projects about the
borderlands.

Note: I always make the slides for my talks and workshops available online, so
here they are if you want to follow along at home or review the links, etc.,
at a later date.

> Consequently, representation will never be a sufficient approach to
addressing the colonial and neocolonial inscriptions in the digital cultural
record.

<span class="credit">[Risam, _New Digital Worlds_](https://nupress.northwestern.edu/9780810138858/new-digital-worlds/),
19.</span>


Note: Unless your syllabus has changed a lot in the past two months, these
should be familiar lines to you, as they’re from the end of Risam’s
introduction to _New Digital Worlds_. These words are especially relevant to
me because of how we think about what the process of mapping is. 

Maps strike us as representations of the world around us, and when we use the
word more abstractly, like in talking about mental maps or cognitive maps,
we’re inscribing a topography that is representative of a collection of
concepts. 

But maps are terrible at mimesis.

> Not only is it easy to lie with maps, it’s essential. To portray meaningful relationships for a complex, three-dimensional world on a flat sheet of paper or a video screen, a map must distort reality. 

<span class="credit">[Monmonier, _How to Lie with
Maps_](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/H/bo27400568.html),
7.</span>

Note: Monmonier opens “How to Lie with maps” with this provocation,
immediately foregrounding the relationship between distortion and mapping.
Monmonier continues:

As a scale model, the map must use symbols that almost always are proportionally much bigger or thicker than the features they represent. To avoid hiding critical in­ formation in a fog of detail, the map must offer a selective, incomplete view of reality. There's no escape from the carto­ graphic paradox: to present a useful and truthful picture, an accurate map must tell white lies.

In some ways, then, we can imagine that the mere process of mapping serves
as moving past mere representation in constructing the poscolonial digital
cultural record.

That doesn’t sound right, though. We’re still exhibiting a failure of the
spatial imagination.

<span class="credit">[_Codex Mendoza_](https://codicemendoza.inah.gob.mx/inicio.php) (c.1541) and Cortés, [_Mexico City_](https://www.newberry.org/file/hern-n-cort-s-mexico-city-1524-woodcut-vault-ayer-65551c8-1524d-0) (1524), in [Massey, _For Space_](https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/for-space/book227109), 2–3.</span>

Note: Doreen Massey begins _For Space_ with a set of ruminations, of failures
of spatial imagination. "Failure in the sense of being inadequate to face up
to the challenges of space; a failure to take on board its coeval
multiplicities, to accept its radical contemporaneity, to deal with its
constitutive complexity.” I like the juxtaposition Massey provides here,
between one “map” that tells a story embedded in time, and the other map that
serves only to inform and control.

This is one way of thinking about the resistant digital map, then. In telling
a story, it positions itself within a historical narrative that it constructs
and frames. This is an opportunity, of course, for the person or people
creating the resistant digital map. In the short essay I wrote for Torn Apart,
I already mention Johanna Drucker’s idea of the visualization as a knowledge
generator, and in telling a new story never before told, maybe resistant
digital maps do the same.

But let’s spend a little more time with the Códice and view it as an online
exhibition funded by the instituto nacional de antropología e historia.

Note: A story embedded in time. 

brokenness of google.

What is behind the impulse to put this on google maps?

Let’s talk a bit about the story of informing and controlling.

## Cartography<br/><small>(the Ideal)</small>

Note: Map historian Matthew Edney combined a lifetime of research into the
field of carography to produce this 2019 book, which argues for the end of
Cartography.

## The Cartography Ideal <!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

In the _West_:

* ? – ~1800: Maps, charts, etc., are all different
* ~1800 – ~1900: All mapping should be “cartography,” unified by projective
  geometry and scale
* ~1900 – ~1970: All mapping *is* “cartography,” even property mapping. 
* ~1970 – present: The ideal is critiqued, yet now more reproduced than ever,
  online.

---

## The Cartography Ideal <!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

* Ontology: The map is a reduction of the world/archive.
* Pictorialness: The map is an unmediated/mimetic presentation of the world
* Individuality: Making/using maps are acts of individual cognition
* Materiality: Maps are things in specific moments
* Observation: Maps are grounded in observation and measurement

Note: Edney gives a bunch of preconceptions of the cartographic ideal

---

## The Cartography Ideal <!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

* Efficacy: Maps are there to be used, especially for navigation
* Discipline: Maps can be incorrect and later corrected
* Publicity: Maps are for wide use
* Morality: Mappers are morally obligated to make the best maps
* Singularity/Universality: there is one map.

---

## The Cartography Ideal <!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

> The normative map must be eliminated, likewise the conviction that it is
meaningful to talk about “maps” or “the map” as a generic category of
phenomena.

href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/C/bo34094164.html"><i>Cartography</i></a>,
233.</span>

Note: But in closing, Edney indicates the need for an end to maps as our
objects of discussion and, instead about mapping. I should be talking about
resistant digital mapping and not resistant digital maps, but there’s a reason
I chose the latter.

## The Cartography Ideal <!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

> Map scholars need to study the processes of mapping… Mapping processes are
fluid, the maps they generate are mutable and volatile. Nothing about mapping
is fixed and stable… Map scholars must stop saying “maps are” and instead say
“X mapping is.”

## Situated Digital Mapping<!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

> [This essay is] an argument for situated and embodied knowledges and
an argument against various forms of unlocatable, and so irresponsible,
knowledge claims.<!-- .element: style="font-size: 70%;" -->

> Situated knowledges require that the object of knowledge be pictured as an
actor and agent, not as a screen or a ground or a resource, never finally as
slave to the master that closes off the dialectic in his unique agency and his
authorship of “objective” knowledge.<!-- .element: style="font-size: 70%;" -->

<span class="credit">Haraway, <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/3178066">“Situated Knowledges,”</a> 583, 590.</span>

Note: The resistant digital map is an instance of situational digital mapping.

Note: This is a 1576 map of Vilnius, the current capital of Lithuania. Monmonier
talks about having a Scandinavian map in your home because you're proud of
your Scandinavian heritage. My mom's family is from Lithuania, so I figured
I'd do something similar here. As a side note, I finished my dissertation
while living in an attic in this building.

## Leaflet

* [Freely available JavaScript library](http://leafletjs.com)
* Non-trivial learning curve
* Brilliant for creating interactive maps
* (Seemingly) Relies on Web Mercator Projection
* Many JavaScript frameworks tap into Leaflet’s API to make an even more
  ergonomic development experience.

Note: You’ve probably used Leaflet as a user many times already. It’s a
popular alternative to Google Maps that lets developers avoid all of Google’s
traps and obstacles.

## Resist the Web and Make It Bend to You<!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

1. Get and download a map you like (or [use the Vilnius map](https://i.imgur.com/klz6lLe.jpg))
2. Make a short list of points of interest (or copy these: `Das hoche Slochs,
   Das Slochs, S. Iohan kirche, Das Rhathaus, Die Deutsche gaße`)
3. Go to
   [`http://antirubbersheeter.moacir.com`](http://antirubbersheeter.moacir.com)

## Discussion for Today <!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

* What is a map?
* Do you need a map?
* What is a good map? 
* What makes one better than another?
* How do you improve a map you have?
* Can We Make a Situated Digital Map?
