For <a href="https://www.idrh.ku.edu/">IDRH</a> Digital Storytelling Fellows at U. Kansas, 26 March 2021
</small>

Note: Thanks all for coming. Thanks Sylvia for the invitation.

I bring you glad tidings from lands that have welcomed many throughout
history, including the Wappinger and Munsee Lenape peoples as noted in the map
behind me, an instance of its own cartographically driven digital mapping. 

I’ll be talking today about some things that are very comfortable for me and a
bunch of things that are kind of new and that I’m thinking about every day. 

I’m also very worried I’ll be repeating some of what you all heard yesterday.
I had hoped to tune in on Annita Lucchesi’s talk, but sometimes these things
don’t work out. 

To that end let me switch over to more presentational version of the front
part of this workshop.

Note: I presented a chapter of my dissertation in 2009, I think, to my patient colleagues in the American cultures workshop. In was about John Dos Passos's work _USA_ and included this map that I had built.

Map didn't make the final cut.

> [I close <u>How to Lie with Maps</u> with] a cautionary note about the
increased likelihood of cartographic distortion when a map must play the dual
role of both <b>informing and impressing</b> its audience.

<span class="credit">[Monmonier, _How to Lie with
Maps_](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/H/bo27400568.html),
157.</span>

Note: In the early 90s classic How to Lie with Maps, Marc Monmonier begins the
epilogue with this remark

---

> A flashy map, in color with an unconventional projection, touts its author’s
sense of innovation, and cartographic window dressing in a doctoral
dissertation or academic journal suggests the work is scholarly or scientific.

Maps_](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/H/bo27400568.html),

Note: This stung

But now I’m sympathetic. And he’s probably even right.

## Latour and “Paper-work” <!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

* Mobile yet Immutable
* Flat
* Modifiable Scale
* Free to Reproduce
* Recombinable / Superimposable / Annotatable
* Geometric

<span class="credit">Latour, <a href="http://www.bruno-latour.fr/node/293.html">“Visualisation and Cognition: Drawing Things Together”</a></span>

Note: Latour tells the story of La Pérouse, sent from Versailles to determine
whether Sakhalin is an island.

Note: Doreen Massey begins _For Space_ with a set of ruminations, of failures
of spatial imagination. "Failure in the sense of being inadequate to face up
to the challenges of space; a failure to take on board its coeval
multiplicities, to accept its radical contemporaneity, to deal with its
constitutive complexity. I like the juxtaposition Massey provides here,
between one “map” that tells a story embedded in time, and the other map that
serves only to inform and control.

## Cartography<br/><small>(the Ideal)</small>

<img alt="Cover of Edney’s Cartography"
	src="https://i.imgur.com/hsEWOjV.jpg"

Note: Map historian Matthew Edney combined a lifetime of research into the
field of carography to produce this 2019 book, which argues for the end of
Cartography.

## The Cartography Ideal <!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

In the _West_:

* ? – ~1800: Maps, charts, etc., are all different
* ~1800 – ~1900: All mapping should be “cartography,” unified by projective
  geometry and scale
* ~1900 – ~1970: All mapping *is* “cartography,” even property mapping. “Why
  maps?” is irrelevant.
* ~1970 – present: The ideal is critiqued, yet now more reproduced than ever,
  online.

---

## The Cartography Ideal <!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

* Ontology: The map is a reduction of the world/archive.
* Pictorialness: The map is an unmediated/mimetic presentation of the world
* Individuality: Making/using maps are acts of individual cognition
* Materiality: Maps are things in specific moments
* Observation: Maps are grounded in observation and measurement

---

## The Cartography Ideal <!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

* Efficacy: Maps are there to be used, especially for navigation
* Discipline: Maps can be incorrect and later corrected
* Publicity: Maps are for wide use
* Morality: Mappers are morally obligated to make the best maps
* Singularity/Universality: there is one map.

---

## The Cartography Ideal <!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

> The normative map must be eliminated, likewise the conviction that it is
meaningful to talk about “maps” or “the map” as a generic category of
phenomena.

---

## The Cartography Ideal <!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

> Map scholars need to study the processes of mapping… Mapping processes are
fluid, the maps they generate are mutable and volatile. Nothing about mapping
is fixed and stable… Map scholars must stop saying “maps are” and instead say
“X mapping is.”

## Situated Digital Mapping<!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

> [This essay is] an argument for situated and embodied knowledges and
an argument against various forms of unlocatable, and so irresponsible,
knowledge claims.<!-- .element: style="font-size: 70%;" -->

> Situated knowledges require that the object of knowledge be pictured as an
actor and agent, not as a screen or a ground or a resource, never finally as
slave to the master that closes off the dialectic in his unique agency and his
authorship of “objective” knowledge.<!-- .element: style="font-size: 70%;" -->

<span class="credit">Haraway, <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/3178066">“Situated Knowledges,”</a> 583, 590.</span>

<img style="width: 80%;" alt="Vilna Lituaniae metropolis" src="https://i.imgur.com/klz6lLe.jpg">

Note: This is a 1576 map of Vilnius, the current capital of Lithuania. Monmonier
talks about having a Scandinavian map in your home because you're proud of
your Scandinavian heritage. My mom's family is from Lithuania, so I figured
I'd do something similar here. As a side note, I finished my dissertation
while living in an attic in this building.

## Questions for Today / Options

* What is a map?

* What is a good map?

* How do you improve a map you have?
* Can We Make a Situated Digital Map?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

## Leaflet

* [Freely available JavaScript library](http://leafletjs.com)
* Non-trivial learning curve
* Brilliant for creating interactive maps
* (Seemingly) Relies on Web Mercator Projection
* Many JavaScript frameworks tap into Leaflet’s API to make an even more
  ergonomic development experience.

Note: You’ve probably used Leaflet as a user many times already. It’s a
popular alternative to Google Maps that lets developers avoid all of Google’s
traps and obstacles.

## Let’s Make the Web Bend to You<!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

1. Get and download a map you like (or [use the Vilnius map](https://i.imgur.com/klz6lLe.jpg))
2. Make a short list of points of interest (or copy these: `Das hoche Slochs,
   Das Slochs, S. Iohan kirche, Das Rhathaus, Die Deutsche gaße`)
3. Go to
   [`http://antirubbersheeter.moacir.com`](http://antirubbersheeter.moacir.com)
